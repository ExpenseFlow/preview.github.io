Perfect! I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the ExpenseFlow website redesign. The plan covers:

## Summary

**Landing Page**
- Minimalist design with gold theme matching the app
- Hero section with city-waypoints.jpeg background
- Features, pricing ($2/mo + enterprise), and clear CTAs
- Links to app (https://get.expenseflow.app) and contact

**Privacy Policy Updates**
- Addresses all 8 issues from TICKET.md (Apple App Store requirements)
- 4 new major sections: Location Data & Trip Tracking, Background Location Tracking, Third-Party Services, Privacy Rights
- GDPR/CCPA compliance statements
- Offline access mechanism disclosure
- High-level summaries only (no implementation details)

**Terms of Use Updates**
- New Section 5.1: Support Access & Data Consent
- Documents that support tickets grant implicit consent for data access
- Access is logged, limited, and revoked after resolution

**Technical Approach**
- Static HTML/CSS only (no frameworks)
- Self-contained styles.css with gold theme
- Mobile-responsive, accessible, fast loading
- Consistent design across all pages

The plan is ready for your review and approval.
